# Steps to Run
### Clone
- If you haven't already, make sure that the backend server is running. This is a <a href="https://github.com/midorinom/space_blog_backend">link</a> to the repository and instructions on how to do so.
- Clone the repository into a directory
- In the terminal, run ```npm i```

### Run App
- In the terminal, run ```npm start```. A browser should automatically launch bringing you to http://localhost:3000. Otherwise, manually open a browser and visit http://localhost:3000/.
- If the backend server is running, the web app is now functional.

### .env File
Make sure that ```REACT_APP_API_URL="http://localhost:5001/api"``` is inside the .env file. Otherwise, create a .env file with it.

### Technologies Used
- React, Typescript, MaterialUI, react-router-dom, dayjs, dotenv
